            <p class="myParagraph">I first started my undergraduate
                coursework at Hunter College as
                Psychology and biological sciences
                majors. I had immigrated to the
                United States the year before to
                pursue higher education and work
                opportunities that were not
                available to women in Iran.
                In my third year as a student there,
                I enrolled in a computer science class
                to satisfy my general education
                requirements and quickly became
                fascinated with the subject.
                I was drawn to how much I could
                relate my observations about the
                world around me with the concepts
                I studied in my textbooks.
                In that first class, I met the
                man who later became my husband.
                He is a very successful Software
                Engineer and works for a startup
                company. His special passion
                for Computer coding and
                computer science class excited
                and motivated me in both an
                intellectual and deeply
                personal way.</p>
            <p class="myParagraph">As someone who went through two major
                moves, first from Iran to Germany and
                then Germany to the United States,
                I believe that my experience also
                gives me greater insight and
                understanding into how the evolution
                of technology moves at rapid pace and
                how coding is impacting the future of
                technology and the future of our lives
                in ways weâ€™re only beginning to
                understand.</p>
