                    <p>I first started my undergraduate coursework at Hunter College in psychology and biological
                        sciences. I had immigrated to the United States a year before to pursue my higher education and
                        explore work opportunities that were not available to women in Iran. In my third year as a
                        student here, I enrolled in a computer science class to satisfy my general education
                        requirements. As a consequence I quickly became fascinated with the subject. I was drawn to how
                        much I could relate my observations about the world around me with the concepts I studied in
                        this class. In that first class, I met the man who later became my husband. He is a very
                        successful Software Engineer and works for a startup company now as a full stack engineer. His
                        special passion for computer coding and computer science classes excited and motivated me
                        intellectualy and personaly.</p>

                    <p> As someone who went through two major envirenmental changes, first from Iran to Germany and
                        then Germany to the United States, I believe that I started to realise the important of
                        technology. My experience also gives me greater insight and understanding of how the evolution
                        of technology moves at rapid pace and how coding is impacting our future and the future of the
                        next generations in ways weâ€™re only beginning to understand.</p>
